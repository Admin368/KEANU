I need to use batch to check if a variable contains a certain word. (in this example, they will contain the word "1234"). This is my current code:

set chs=Hello 1234 World.
if "%ch%" == "*1234*" (
    echo You cannot use this word in your screen name.
) else (
    goto continue
)

What you want to do is to pipe the line to search 
into find command and then check errorlevel. 
If it finds the specified string
 then it returns "0" if not - "1".

set a=Hello 1234 World.
echo %a% | find "1" > nul
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo The string is found
) else (
    echo The string is not found
)
You can also use conditional execution
 (see this link for more info)

set a=Hello 1234 World.
echo %a% | find "1234" > nul && echo The string is found || echo The string is not fo
