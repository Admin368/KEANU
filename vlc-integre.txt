Using vlc -I null --play-and-exit [arguments], vlc opens in the background without appearing in the taskbar or system tray.

However, it can be seen when 'more details' is clicked in task manager.

For example, when you want to play audio while vlc is hidden:

vlc -I null --play-and-exit "C:\Windows.old\Users\Public\Music\Sample Music\Kalimba.mp3"
